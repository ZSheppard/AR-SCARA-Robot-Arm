# AR SCARA Robot Arm
SCARA Robot Arm created using C++ and the OpenCV library to display in AR.
Starting on this project I first learned the necessary fundamental concepts for creating a coordinate system and connecting joints for a robot. This began with learning 2D and 3D coordinate system transformations. I used the properties of homogeneous transformation matrices to rotate and translate the robot.
